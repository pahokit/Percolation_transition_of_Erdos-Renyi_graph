My goal was to study the critical behavior of the system at the percolation transition point of the Erdős-Rényi graph numerically. For this, I investigated the behaviour of the two largest connected components. I generated samples with fixed average node degree (the critical value) and measured the size of the two largest connected components as a function of the number of nodes or the linking probability. (I used more samples with the same parameters and I only used their provided result's average for higher precision.)
Key questions answered:
- How does the size of the largest connected component scales with the system size at the critical point?
- How does the size of the largest connected component grows with "p"  at the critical point?
